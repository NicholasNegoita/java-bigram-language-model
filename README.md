# java-bigram-language-model
A Java implementation of a bigram language model trained on public-domain text.

Important: the model requires a local text file for training. 

Please download alice.txt and copy its absolute file path into the code.
On Windows, you can access its absolute file path by holding left shift,
right clicking the file, and then clicking "Copy as path". Once copied, 
replace the filePath variable with it.
